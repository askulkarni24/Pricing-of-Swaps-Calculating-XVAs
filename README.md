# Pricing of Swaps \& Calculating XVAs

Aspects of modern sell-side quant modeling include funding costs, XVA metrics, initial margin, credit risk mitigation, central clearing, SOFR rates, FRTB and balance sheet management. 

In our experiment, we build a small-scale computer system for counter-party risk management of collateralized fixed income portfolios, and incorporate modern frameworks for interest rate simulation and capital management. Starting with mathematical tools for computing credit valuation adjustments such as $CVA$ and $DVA$, we move on to cover pricing and regulation, with an emphasis on the computational aspects of regulatory credit risk capital under Basel 3 and finally conclude with FRTB framework for market risk capital. 

More specifically, we present Stochastic Exposure Modeling for Swaps using a model where the stochasticity is generated by Brownian motions - a specialized class of HJM models that allow for a Markov representation of price/rates. Expected Exposure is then calculated under cases of no-collateral, with Variation Margin and with both Variation and Initial Margin present (SIMM). 

Then we go on to present numerical methods to arrive at various valuation adjustments - xVAs (CVA, DVA, FVA, MVA). Finally, we conclude by presenting requirements for Regulatory Capital under Basel and the IRB Approach. The numerical algorithms which used Monte Carlo simulations behind the scenes, were efficiently optimized using vectorization/numpy.
